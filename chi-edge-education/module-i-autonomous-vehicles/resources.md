Important Note: This sample data is just that, sample data. 
Do not expect this to work on every track and environment.
This sample data is collected from the real world, in a particular room with a specific
car pattern, and tape. The exact environment is shown below, in the section titled 
model testing.
While this sample data can be used to bolster your own data, do not expect it
to run perfectly.
