# FOR INSTRUCTOR or TA

**Important Note:**

Every teacher and student is different. It is impossible for every contingency or preference to be accounted for. However, through the Github, which contains all the information in this Gitbook, you can make changes to the md files by downloading them as pdfs and editing them to better suit your class.&#x20;

Some parts of the procedure below may not be relevant to your class because you may want them to build their own cars or not

**Procedure**

1. Buy the car (or a few for each student group). Controllers are optional but **recommended** due to the difficulty with driving with a keyboard and mouse through the WebUI.

_There are many options for this laid out in the page titled "Buying or Building Your Own Car" and so are instructions for building cars from scratch. Seller options are restated below._&#x20;
