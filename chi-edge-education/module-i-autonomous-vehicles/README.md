# Module I - Autonomous Vehicles

The following project, as a part of CHI@Edge Education initiative, can act as a bridge between computer engineers and computer scientists (reflecting the difference between the software and hardware domains).&#x20;

It can be used to introduce knowledge of both low-level hardware integration with software libraries and high-level machine learning implementations.&#x20;

```
Time for Completion: 8-10 hours
```
