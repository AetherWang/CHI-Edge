# Module I - Autonomous Vehicles

> **Please read the "README: Pathway Structure" page in order to understand how to best utilize this learning tool.**&#x20;
>
> **It is in the same order hierarchy as the CHI@Edge Education page.**
>
> **If you are an individual/general public learner, please navigate to the Self-Learners page and if you are an educator/TA please navigate to the FOR EDUCATORS page.**&#x20;

**How to Use Module**

The following project, as a part of CHI@Edge Education initiative, can act as a bridge between computer engineers and computer scientists (reflecting the difference between the software and hardware domains).&#x20;

> **Building your own RC car or completely making a car from scratch with 3D-printing/DIY is beyond the scope of this educational module.**

It can be used to introduce knowledge of both low-level hardware integration with software libraries and high-level machine learning implementations.&#x20;

<pre><code><strong>Estimated Time for Completion: 8-10 hours
</strong></code></pre>
