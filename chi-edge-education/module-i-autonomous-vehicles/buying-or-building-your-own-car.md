# Buying or Building Your Own Car

### Options for Buying

The original car utilized in the creation of this pipeline is the [Waveshare Pi Racer](https://www.waveshare.com/piracer-ai-kit.htm). There are other options for buying cars and you can compare the components with that of Waveshare to make sure that everything works as intended.

It is recommended to just buy the Waveshare car, but buying from other sellers and rolling your own car can also be good options.

### Rolling your Car (Building)

The [Donkeycar Documentation](https://docs.donkeycar.com/cars/roll\_your\_own/) discusses in great detail the necessary parts and configurations that must be bought and assembled, even sCAD designs for the chassis are included.

If you desire to build your own car from scratch, then by comparing the documentation with your shopping cart, there should be no problems.

There is an additional thing to buy not discussed in rolling your own car because it is not technically a part of the car: the controller.&#x20;

**Controllers:**

_Note: a controller is not required for using Donkeycar, since that car can be controlled using the keyboard, but it is preferred to make steering easier when collecting training data._

The Donkeycar docs support multiple types of controllers from Xbox, Dualshock, and more.&#x20;

Here is the controller recommended by Donkeycar: [Logitech Xbox.](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-940-000117-Gamepad-F710/dp/B0041RR0TW/ref=sr\_1\_1?keywords=Logitech+Wireless+Gamepad+f710\&qid=1552492996\&s=electronics\&sr=1-1)

### **Completing the Project Without a Car**

If funds are an issue then it is possible to complete this project without using a physical car. Doing the project this way will miss out on assembling a car, using Chi@Edge, using a Raspberry Pi, and all of the other physical setups for the project, but it will still include collecting training data, cleaning the data, and training a model. This can be done using Donkeycar's simulator. Go to the [Optional: Simulator Setup](optional-simulator-setup.md) page to learn more about using Donkeycar's simulated environment instead of a physical car.
