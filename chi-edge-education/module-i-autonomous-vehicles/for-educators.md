# FOR EDUCATORS

Every teacher and student is different. It is impossible for every contingency or preference to be accounted for. However, through the Github, which contains all the information in this Gitbook, you can make changes to the md files by downloading them as pdfs and editing them to better suit your class.&#x20;

Some parts of the procedure below may not be relevant to your class because you may want them to build their own cars or not even consider hardware at all. Therefore three pathways are presented below for instructors and classes with different goals.&#x20;

The first pathway, dubbed the **Regular Path**, allows the student to learn about hardware through assembly and driving, edge devices, cloud computing, software/programming, and UNIX. It also has project extensions with example results, an additional assignment, and some extra information.

The second pathway, dubbed the **Classroom Path**, presumes that a TA is present to take care of the edge, cloud, and hardware components of this project, but that the student does everything else found in the Regular Path.

The third pathway, dubbed the **Digital Path**, allows the student to skip hardware altogether and just focus on software. It requires setting up a simulation environment on a local computer.&#x20;



**Next Steps:**

The guide is mainly geared towards the Classroom pathway, but is similar even if adapted to the otherway pathways.&#x20;

Inside of [**Pathways**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/9ZmykIyWVcR3SiBHUEH6/s/OqqSEReFLPNjJeHsoCRd/\~/changes/25/chi-edge-education/module-i-autonomous-vehicles/pathways) is where you will find the next steps for this project.

If you are just looking for sample data or resources, they will be in the [**Resources**](http://localhost:5000/o/9ZmykIyWVcR3SiBHUEH6/s/OqqSEReFLPNjJeHsoCRd/) page. The instructions for utilizing sample data is essentially the same as without, just cutting out some early steps.

If you are looking for academic or referenced material, they will be in the [**References**](http://localhost:5000/o/9ZmykIyWVcR3SiBHUEH6/s/OqqSEReFLPNjJeHsoCRd/) page.&#x20;
