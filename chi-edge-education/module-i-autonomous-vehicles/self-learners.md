# Self-Learners

In classroom and university settings, the teacher/TA will usually have a specific goal in mind for a project and therefore, things may be abridged. For example, hardware set-up may not done by the students, however, self-learners do not have this luxury because you are on your own.&#x20;

### Pathways Available:

There are two pathways (regular and digital) viable for self-learners.

In the regular pathway you will gain:

```
-familiarity with assembling hardware
-familiarity with cloud and edge computing
-familiarity of UNIX commands
-understanding how to configure hardware and software
-collected data for Machine Learning
-cleaned data for Machine Learning
-trained a Machine Learning model
-actuated a successful Machine Learning model with an autonomous car
```

It also has project extensions with example results, an additional assignment, and some extra information.

However, the Waveshare car necessary for the Regular and Classroom Pathways do have an upfront cost, as will be explained in the Buying and Building Your Own Car page.

Furthermore, if you do not want to pay that much for a car and attempt to make a car yourself, then you will not have much support in building it from these documents because it is beyond the scope of this project.&#x20;

There is a solution to this issue of price and complexity however, if you do not care for the hardware parts of this project.&#x20;

In the digital pathway you will gain:

```
-familiarity with cloud and edge computing
-familiarity of UNIX commands
-learned how to operate simulation software
-collected data for Machine Learning
-cleaned data for Machine Learning
-trained a Machine Learning model
-actuated a successful Machine Learning model with an autonomous car in a simulation
```

This option does not require an upfront cost and eliminates the hardware by mimicking the real world with Unity Game Engine.



**Next Steps:**

Inside of [**Pathways**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/9ZmykIyWVcR3SiBHUEH6/s/OqqSEReFLPNjJeHsoCRd/\~/changes/25/chi-edge-education/module-i-autonomous-vehicles/pathways) is where you will find the next steps for this project.

If you are just looking for sample data or resources, they will be in the [**Resources**](resources.md) page. The instructions for utilizing sample data is essentially the same as without, just cutting out some early steps.

If you are looking for academic or referenced material, they will be in the [**References**](references.md) page.&#x20;

If you have any trouble, please look to the [**FAQ**](faq.md) page.
