# Reserve a Bare-Metal Node

Creating reservations for both the pi and a bare-metal node is done using this [Trovi artifact](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/experiment/share/8800ebd1-411e-4e94-9b62-6883f09188e7). This Trovi artifact has all of the steps required to help you reserve the node without understanding the ins and outs of Chameleon Cloud.&#x20;

It has a Jupyter-like interface and has great documentation.&#x20;
