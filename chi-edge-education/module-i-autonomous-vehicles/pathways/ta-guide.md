# TA Guide

**Note:**

It is highly recommended that the user just buys the Waveshare cars and does not attempt to mess around with RC Cars and customizations. As state previously, building those cars, connecting them to the Raspberry Pis, and so on are beyond the scope of this module.&#x20;

References to other pages are contained within the Classroom Pathway and are marked with an identifier in front of the page name (TA) to indicate that they are not to be done by students.&#x20;

The (Optional) marker indicates that the page may be extraneous assignments or background information that the students do not need to go over.&#x20;

Backgound Information is likely unncessary for most teachers because they would have already set  the class up to undertake this project.

**Preparation**

1. Buy the car (or a few for each student group).&#x20;

_Controllers are optional but **recommended** due to the difficulty with driving with a keyboard and mouse through the WebUI._

2. Sign in to your Chameleon Account.&#x20;
3. Complete the steps in the page titled "Adding Pi and Leasing Chameleon Node," as well as the subpage "Reserving your Pi on CHI@Edge." Every car needs to be added.
4. Assemble the car by following the page title "Car Assembly."
5. On the leased Chameleon Node, set-up the computer by following the steps in the page titled "Configuring Chameleon Node for Training."
6. (Optional) If you want the students to have better data, you may want to construct a track out of tape because the waveshare track is not good. Make sure that the lanes are wide and that the turns are not sharp.&#x20;
