# Chi@Edge

**What is Chi@Edge?**

Chi@Edge is a testbed offered by Chameleon Cloud for students, researchers, and educators to work on edge computing projects and research. It offers edge devices available for reservation so that users can run experiments without needing the hardware directly in front of them. Chi@Edge also offers bring-your-own-device so that users can register their own edge device to Chi@Edge and control which projects have access.

**Why use Chi@Edge?**

We are using Chi@Edge because it allows for easy reproducibility of experiments. Since Chameleon's Trovi platform allows us to share our code for creating the containers on the Pi, this means future users of this project can always get started in the same way that we did. If we were not using Chi@Edge, students attempting to complete this project may run into problems launching a container on their pi in the same way that we did because of discrepancies in the way the container is created.
