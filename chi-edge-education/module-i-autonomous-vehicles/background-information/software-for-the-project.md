# Software for the Project

## Donkeycar

Donkeycar is an open-source self-driving car platform. It allows hobbyists and raspberry pi enthusiasts to implement self-driving in their RC (remote-controlled) cars without having to mess with the low-level details. Donkeycar has an extensive community working to expand the software and make Donkeycar more accessible.

We chose to use Donkeycar because of its high-level abstraction and ease of experimentation. Donkeycar bridges the gap between the hardware of your car and the machine learning implemented in Python so that the experimenter does not need to worry about writing code.

To learn more about Donkeycar you can visit the [Donkeycar website](https://www.donkeycar.com/) and also read the [Donkeycar docs](http://docs.donkeycar.com/).
