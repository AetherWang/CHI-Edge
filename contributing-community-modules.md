# Contributing Community Modules

**Submitting Your Own Educational Module**

For creating your own educational module, you can:

1. fork the existing [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AetherWang/CHI-Edge) for this project
2. sync the fork on Github to a space in your Gitbook account
3. make your changes or additional modules
4. sync the Gitbook to your Github account
5. make a merge request to the original Github repo you forked from

And that's it!&#x20;
