# CHI@Edge Education

> Built on top of the NSF-funded Chameleon testbed, we aim to provide free and accessible education for individuals of all backgrounds and skill-levels. We hope to inspire other NSF testbeds to create similar education initiatives, benefitting society by spreading knowledge and lowering barriers to entry.

**CHI@Edge educational module** brings various topics on edge computing, IoT technologies, and applications driven by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence – bringing tools and ideas in today’s technology-driven world. **These modules convey accessibility to education with the goal to shorten the gap** in the contribution of research and to provide broad knowledge of technology as a tool that can enhance people’s lives.

In this particular module, hands-on experience has essential importance. Theory and concepts are also necessary to contribute to unexplored cutting-edge technologies. **With this motivation, our educational modules** bring hands-on sessions to allow students to attain knowledge, being comfortable with concepts, principles, and methods, – and most importantly to encourage and inspire them new ideas and applications, which can ultimately further improve the boundaries of technology.

**In this module, CHI@Edge Education** makes open learning to enable a all-around range of people and any individual with any background, technical skill, or experience to learn and get familiar with autonomous vehicles technologies, cloud computing concepts, edge and IoT devices, and Artificial Intelligence driven applications.
