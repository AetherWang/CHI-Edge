# How to Provide Feedback

Have suggestions for improvements we can make to these educational modules? Post any comments, questions, or concerns to the [discussions page on the Chi@Edge Education GitHub repo](https://github.com/AetherWang/CHI-Edge/discussions). As we are in the early stages of developing Chi@Education, we hope to be very responsive to any feedback from instructors, students, and any members of the community so please let us know how we are doing.
